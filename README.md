# TweetExtract
A client to enable better Twitter data extraction

TweetExtract is a Python wrapper class to enable easy and quick cleanup/extraction of Twitter datasets based on hashtags

In order to run TweetExtract, ensure that you obtain the correct Twitter developer credentials, and add them to the same directory as the source class, as a json file.

Post running the helper, the extracted data would be present in a .csv format, in a /data subdirectory
